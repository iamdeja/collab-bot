          <h3>So what the heck is Git</h3>
          <p>
            Git is the most popular version control system (VCS) out there. In
            very general terms, a VCS is a system that keeps track of files and
            actions in a project, serving both as a changelog and as a backup.
            Want to roll back to a previous version of a file? Git has you
            covered. Want to roll back your whole project prior to a massive
            bug? Git has you covered. The point of git? Git has you covered.
          </p>
          <p>
            The place where all your files are stored is called a
            <em>repository</em>. With git, this repository is downloaded by all
            members working on the project, giving it a decentralised structure:
            if you delete your copy, not all is lost. This stays true even if
            the repository is hosted on a central main server. The point of
            decentralisation? Git has you covered.
          </p>
          <h4>Wow, filesize pls</h4>
          <p>
            Git doesn't actually store a copy of all versions of all your files:
            it stores the differences between different versions of the files,
            which helps keeping filesize down but also to see the exact changes.
            But enough with the backstory, let's see how we can use it.
          </p>
          <h4>Gimme git</h4>
          <p>
            Sure. The only cost is checking out the
            <a
              href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git"
              >installation guide</a
            >. Once you have your shiny copy of git, let's get started with
            using it.
          </p>
          <h3>How to use it</h3>
          <p>
            Git may seem scary at first and you may think it's all about command
            line interfaces (CLI) and you gotta remember stuff. Luckily that
            isn't true. This isn't some high school exam, you can have this
            guide or any git documentation open all day any day. You can even
            lean back in your chair! You will naturally pick up the basic
            commands and logic as you use them, but try to sit straight to also
            pick up good posture.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you're still concerned, Git also has graphical user interfaces
            (GUI) and most of the work will be done with integrations in your
            favourite code editor. Yes that is correct, unless you want to feel
            like a hacker, you will only need the CLI when something goes very
            wrong.
          </p>
          <h4>Creating a repository</h4>
          <p>
            In case you are using the command line, creating a new git
            repository or converting an existing folder into one is as easy as
            typing
            <code>git init</code> in the directory (fancy word for folder) on
            your machine.
          </p>
          <h4>Checking out a repository</h4>
          <p>
            Repositories can be either local or hosted on a server. Checking a
            repository out means creating a copy of it elsewhere. It is often
            referred to as "cloning".
          </p>
          <p>
            If the git repository is local, you can make a copy of it using
            <code>git clone /path/to/repository</code>. If however you want to
            get a local copy of a remotely hosted repository, you can get it
            using <code>git clone remote-link</code>. There are two types of
            remote links:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              HTTPS urls:
              <code>https://host.name/path/to/repository</code>
            </li>
            <li>
              SSH links:
              <code>username@host:/path/to/repository</code>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Cloning a repository over SSH often requires you to set up SSH keys,
            but all main git host platforms have their easy to follow guides on
            how to set up these keys.
          </p>
          <h4>Letting git know</h4>
          <p>
            Git doesn't track your files by default. You can tell git to watch a
            file using <code>git add &ltfilename&gt</code> or
            <code>git add .</code> to add everything in the directory to the
            watchlist.
          </p>
          <p>
            Git tracking your files doesn't mean every time you save your file
            the change gets stored (like OneDrive for example). To make git save
            the relevant state of your files, you use the
            <code>git commit -m "Commit message"</code> command. This saves the
            changes with the message you have set.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's a good idea to have simple and clear commit messages, so that
            you can later understand and find changes in the git history.
          </p>
          <h4>Letting the world know</h4>
          <p>
            Committing files saves them in your local copy, however if you are
            working with remote repositories you have to upload your changes
            somehow. This is done via the <code>git push</code> command. The
            full syntax for this command is
            <code>git push &ltrepository&gt &ltbranch&gt</code> but more on that
            later. If you haven't configured specific remote repositories, the
            default is "origin". The default branch is "master".
          </p>
          <p>
            On that note, if you haven't added cloned from a remote repository,
            you can add the remote repository using
            <code>git remote add origin &ltserver&gt</code>, where "server" is
            the HTTPS or SSH link. Replacing "origin" allows you to create and
            name multiple remote repositories such as "upstream", but that falls
            out of the basics.
