      <h3 id="whatis">So what the heck is Git</h3>
      <p>
        Git is the most popular version control system (VCS) out there. In
        very general terms, a VCS is a system that keeps track of files and
        actions in a project, serving both as a changelog and as a backup.
        Want to roll back to a previous version of a file? Git has you
        covered. Want to roll back your whole project prior to a massive
        bug? Git has you covered. The point of git? Git has you covered.
      </p>
      <p>
        The place where all your files are stored is called a
        <b class="has-annotation" id="repository">repository</b>. With git,
        this repository is downloaded by all members working on the project,
        giving it a decentralised structure: if you delete your copy, not
        all is lost. This stays true even if the repository is hosted on a
        central main server. The point of decentralisation? Git has you
        covered.
      </p>
      <h4 id="filesize-pls">Wow, filesize pls</h4>
      <p>
        Git doesn't actually store a copy of all versions of all your files:
        it stores the differences between different versions of the files,
        which helps keeping filesize down but also to see the exact changes.
        But enough with the backstory, let's see how we can use it.
      </p>
      <h4>Gimme git</h4>
      <p>
        Sure. The only cost is checking out the
        <a
                href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git"
        >installation guide</a
        >. Once you have your shiny copy of git, let's get started with
        using it.
      </p>
      <h3 id="basic-basics">Basic basics</h3>
      <p>
        Git may seem scary at first and you may think it's all about command
        line interfaces (CLI) and you gotta remember stuff. Luckily that
        isn't true. This isn't some high school exam, you can have this
        guide or any git documentation open all day any day. You can even
        lean back in your chair! You will naturally pick up the basic
        commands and logic as you use them, but try to sit straight to also
        pick up good posture.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you're still concerned, Git also has graphical user interfaces
        (GUI) and most of the work will be done with integrations in your
        favourite code editor. Yes that is correct, unless you want to feel
        like a hacker, you will only need the CLI when something goes very
        wrong.
      </p>
      <h4>Creating a repository</h4>
      <p>
        In case you are using the command line, creating a new git
        repository or converting an existing folder into one is as easy as
        typing
        <code>git init</code> in the directory (fancy word for folder) on
        your machine.
      </p>
      <h4>Checking out a repository</h4>
      <p>
        Repositories can be either local or hosted on a server. Checking a
        repository out means creating a copy of it elsewhere. It is often
        referred to as "cloning".
      </p>
      <p>
        If the git repository is local, you can make a copy of it using
        <code>git clone /path/to/repository</code>. If however you want to
        get a local copy of a remotely hosted repository, you can get it
        using <code>git clone remote-link</code>. There are two types of
        remote links:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          HTTPS urls:
          <code>https://host.name/path/to/repository</code>
        </li>
        <li>
          SSH links:
          <code>username@host:/path/to/repository</code>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Cloning a repository over SSH often requires you to set up SSH keys,
        but all main git host platforms have their easy to follow guides on
        how to set up these keys.
      </p>
      <h4>Git isn't a spy</h4>
      <p>
        Git isn't watching your files by default, which means it doesn't
        track changes to your files unless you tell it to. If you want git
        to know about your files, you need to add them to the
        <b class="has-annotation" id="index">Index</b>, commonly known as
        staging area. There, git stores the cumulative changes made to the
        file since the last checkpoint in git's history.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since you wouldn't want to record every single time you save a file,
        as not every save is a meaningful step in your project, files in the
        staging area aren't stored in the git history (Index has its own
        temporary history). When your files reach a state that you would
        like to record, you
        <b class="has-annotation" id="commit">commit</b> these files.
        Committing the files saves the staged changes to the git history,
        where they will stay for good.
      </p>
      <h4>Letting git know</h4>
      <p>
        You can tell git to watch a file using
        <code>git add &ltfilename&gt</code> or <code>git add .</code> to add
        everything in the directory to the watchlist.
      </p>
      <p>
        Again, since since git doesn't update its history on each file save
        (like OneDrive for example) you commit your changes using the
        <code>git commit -m "Commit message"</code> command. This saves the
        changes with the message you have set.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's a good idea to have simple and clear commit messages, so that
        you can later understand and find changes in the git history.
      </p>
      <h4>Letting the world know</h4>
      <p>
        Committing files saves them in your local copy, however if you are
        working with remote repositories you have to upload your changes
        somehow. This is done via the <code>git push</code> command. The
        full syntax for this command is
        <code>git push &ltrepository&gt &ltbranch&gt</code> but more on that
        later. If you haven't configured specific remote repositories, the
        default is "origin". The default branch is "master".
      </p>
      <p>
        On that note, if you haven't cloned from a remote repository, you
        can add the remote repository using
        <code>git remote add origin &ltserver&gt</code>, where "server" is
        the HTTPS or SSH link. Replacing "origin" allows you to create and
        name multiple remote repositories such as "upstream", but that falls
        out of the basics.
      </p>
      <h4>Getting updates</h4>
      <p>
        Sometimes the remote repository gets updated as you are working on
        the local copy. In that case you can update your local copy using
        <code>git pull</code>. When you pull, you tell git to
        <b class="has-annotation" id="fetch">fetch</b> files and
        <b class="has-annotation" id="merge">merge</b> them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sometimes conflicts happen when git is trying to merge files into
        your local repository. Such issues may also happen when you are
        pushing into a repository. What to do in these cases is a topic for
        <a href="#merging">later</a>.
      </p>
      <h3 id="more-stuff">More stuff</h3>
      <h4>Branching</h4>
      <p>
        Where git truly shines, is in it's implementation of
        <b class="has-annotation" id="branching">branching</b>. Branching is
        the concept of experimenting with new ideas or working on different
        versions, without ever affecting your main files. If it didn't work
        out, delete it, if you like what you made, merge it back with the
        main files.
      </p>
      <img
              alt="Git branching example"
              src="../../media/images/git_branching.png"
      />
      <p>
        To make a new branch and then switch to it, use the command
        <code>git switch -c branch_name</code>. To simply switch between
        existing branches, omit the <code>-c</code> option. You can delete a
        branch using <code>git branch -d branch_name</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        You have now created a branch on your local machine, however neither
        the remote repository nor others may access it unless you push it.
        To push a branch, you can use the command
        <code>git push origin branch_name</code>, assuming you haven't
        changed your remote repository's name from "origin" to something
        else.
      </p>
      <h4 id="merging">Merging</h4>
      <p>
        Merging is all about combining files and branches. To merge another
        branch into your active branch you do
        <code>git merge &ltbranch&gt</code>. Make sure you're in the branch
        you want files to be merged <em>to</em>, and not the branch you want
        files merged <em>from</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sometimes, when the changes made to files are incompatible, a merge
        <b id="conflict" class="has-annotation">conflict</b> will occur. In
        these cases you will have to resolve them by choosing for each
        conflicting section which variant you would like to keep. This is
        usually done from within an editor and not CLI.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you have solved the conflicts, dont forget to mark the files as
        merged using <code>git add &ltfilename&gt</code> which we are
        already familiar with.
      </p>
      <p>
        We saw <a href="#filesize-pls">earlier</a> that git only stores
        differences in between files, not copies of each file. These
        differences can be viewed in the git
        <b id="diff" class="has-annotation">diff</b> format, and they are
        best viewed in an editor or using the web UI. To view differences in
        between branches from the CLI, such as before merging after fetching
        for example, use
        <code>git diff &ltsource_branch&gt &lttarget_branch&gt</code>. More
        about the diff command <a href="">here</a>.
      </p>
      <h4>Logging</h4>
      <p>
        Since git is all about tracking, there needs to be a way to see all
        the git history. This is called the git
        <b id="log" class="has-annotation">log</b> and you can view it by
        using....<code>git log</code>. The log is very useful when you need
        to get the <b id="hash" class="has-annotation">hash</b> of a
        particular commit, in order to get more information about it.
      </p>
      <p>
        A useful command to get the changes from a particular author is
        using the <code>--author=name</code> option. There are many many
        options to the log command so you're better off using
        <code>git log --help</code> than reading them here.
      </p>
      <h4>Tagging</h4>
      <p>
        Tags can help you in finding a particular commit, and to keep even
        better track of files. For example, it is good practice to tag all
        released or release ready versions with a release number, kind of
        like Minecraft. You can tag a particular commit using
        <code>git tag tagname hashid</code>, where <code>hashid</code> is
        the first 10 characters of the commit's hash. The ID isn't necessary
        for the current commit.
      </p>
      <h4>Signing</h4>
      <p>
        If you're paranoid, or just fancy, you can sign your commits and
        tags using a GPG key. This identifies the commits to your email and
        checks them with your online account's key (GitHub, GitLab,
        Bitbucket, ...).
      </p>
      <p>
        Below are links to how to generate and add GPG keys to the three
        major platforms:
      </p>
      <ul>

        Wow that was a long read, but you made it through. You should now
        know how to use or at least have an overview of the basic git
        command and tools, and can start using them for work, school, fun,
        in bed, .... Learn git by using git, and soon you'll dabble in more
        advanced concepts. If you're interested in working with the Yuuto
        project, be sure to check out the

        <div class="annotation --repository">
          The repository also stores all the metadata and the git magic for
          your files. On your local machine it is located in a
          <code>.git</code> folder. Delete it and your local history is
          gone.
        </div>
        <div class="annotation --index">
          The Index works as a cache. It stores all the changes that you
          don't necessarily want to commit separately.
        </div>
        <div class="annotation --hash">
          A hash is like a footprint, or commit signature. It is a long
          sequence of letters and numbers that uniquely identifies a commit.
        </div>
        <div class="annotation --conflict">
          Conflicts typically happen when you are trying to merge a file
          which has a newer version that the version you made changes to,
          and git can't figure out which changes to keep.
        </div>
        <div class="annotation --log">
          Using the log with a CLI isn't the most clear and optimised,
          therefore when starting out, it's good to use a GUI or web
          interface.
        </div>
        <div class="annotation --diff">
          The diff format shows additions, removals and changes to files. On
          graphical interfaces, unchanged parts of code are often skipped.
