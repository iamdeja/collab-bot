        <p>
          Git is the most popular version control system (VCS) out there. In
          very general terms, a VCS is a system that keeps track of files and
          actions in a project, serving both as a changelog and as a backup.
          Want to roll back to a previous version of a file? Git has you
          covered. Want to roll back your whole project prior to a massive
          bug? Git has you covered. The point of git? Git has you covered.
        </p>
        <p>
          The place where all your files are stored is called a
          <em>repository</em>. With git, this repository is downloaded by all
          members working on the project, giving it a decentralised structure:
          if you delete your copy, not all is lost. This stays true even if
          the repository is hosted on a central main server. The point of
          decentralisation? Git has you covered.
        </p>
        <h4>Wow, filesize pls</h4>
        <p>
          Git doesn't actually store a copy of all versions of all your files:
          it stores the differences between different versions of the files,
          which helps keeping filesize down but also to see the exact changes.
          But enough with the backstory, let's see how we can use it.
        </p>
        <h4>Gimme git</h4>
        <p>
          Sure. The only cost is checking out the
          <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git">installation guide</a>. Once you have
          your shiny copy of git, let's get started with
          using it.
        </p>
        <h3 id="basic-usage">Basic usage</h3>
        <p>
          Git may seem scary at first and you may think it's all about command
          line interfaces (CLI) and you gotta remember stuff. Luckily that
          isn't true. This isn't some high school exam, you can have this
          guide or any git documentation open all day any day. You can even
          lean back in your chair! You will naturally pick up the basic
          commands and logic as you use them, but try to sit straight to also
          pick up good posture.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you're still concerned, Git also has graphical user interfaces
          (GUI) and most of the work will be done with integrations in your
          favourite code editor. Yes that is correct, unless you want to feel
          like a hacker, you will only need the CLI when something goes very
          wrong.
        </p>
        <h4>Creating a repository</h4>
        <p>
          In case you are using the command line, creating a new git
          repository or converting an existing folder into one is as easy as
          typing
          <code>git init</code> in the directory (fancy word for folder) on
          your machine.
        </p>
        <h4>Checking out a repository</h4>
        <p>
          Repositories can be either local or hosted on a server. Checking a
          repository out means creating a copy of it elsewhere. It is often
          referred to as "cloning".
        </p>
        <p>
          If the git repository is local, you can make a copy of it using
          <code>git clone /path/to/repository</code>. If however you want to
          get a local copy of a remotely hosted repository, you can get it
          using <code>git clone remote-link</code>. There are two types of
          remote links:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            HTTPS urls:
            <code>https://host.name/path/to/repository</code>
          </li>
          <li>
            SSH links:
            <code>username@host:/path/to/repository</code>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Cloning a repository over SSH often requires you to set up SSH keys,
          but all main git host platforms have their easy to follow guides on
          how to set up these keys.
        </p>
        <h4>Git isn't a spy</h4>
        <p>
          Git isn't watching your files by default, which means it doesn't
          track changes to your files unless you tell it to. If you want git
          to know about your files, you need to add them to the
          <em>Index</em>, commonly known as staging area. There, git stores
          the cumulative changes made to the file since the last checkpoint in
          git's history.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since you wouldn't want to record every single time you save a file,
          as not every save is a meaningful step in your project, files in the
          staging area aren't stored in the git history (Index has its own
          temporary history). When your files reach a state that you would
          like to record, you <em>commit</em> these files. Committing the
          files saves the staged changes to the git history, where they will
          stay for good.
        </p>
        <h4>Letting git know</h4>
        <p>
          You can tell git to watch a file using
          <code>git add &ltfilename&gt</code> or <code>git add .</code> to add
          everything in the directory to the watchlist.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, since since git doesn't update its history on each file save
          (like OneDrive for example) you commit your changes using the
          <code>git commit -m "Commit message"</code> command. This saves the
          changes with the message you have set.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's a good idea to have simple and clear commit messages, so that
          you can later understand and find changes in the git history.
        </p>
        <h4>Letting the world know</h4>
        <p>
          Committing files saves them in your local copy, however if you are
          working with remote repositories you have to upload your changes
          somehow. This is done via the <code>git push</code> command. The
          full syntax for this command is
          <code>git push &ltrepository&gt &ltbranch&gt</code> but more on that
          later. If you haven't configured specific remote repositories, the
          default is "origin". The default branch is "master".
        </p>
        <p>
          On that note, if you haven't added cloned from a remote repository,
          you can add the remote repository using
          <code>git remote add origin &ltserver&gt</code>, where "server" is
          the HTTPS or SSH link. Replacing "origin" allows you to create and
          name multiple remote repositories such as "upstream", but that falls
          out of the basics.
        </p>
        <h4>Getting updates</h4>
        <p>
          Sometimes the remote repository gets updated as you are working on
          the local copy. In that case you can update your local copy using
          <code>git pull</code>. When you pull, you tell git to
          <em>fetch</em> files and <em>merge</em> them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sometimes conflicts happen when git is trying to merge files into
          your local repository. Such issue may also happen when you are
          pushing into a repository. What to do in these cases is a topic for
          <a href="#merging">later</a>.
